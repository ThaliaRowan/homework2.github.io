                Hi, My name is Thalia Romany.<br/>

                I love building and creating new things. My interest in this field raised during highschool, where I began researhing more on the job titles<br />

                I attended the Uconn coding bootcamp to begin my journey in learning the skills needed to achieve my goals.

                You can reach me on: <br/>
